# LunarCrime

### Overview
*	Does a full moon impact crime rate?
    * 	In this project, we analyze 2016 crime rates in three major US cities - Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia as they relate to a full moon. We consider various types of crime while observing the cycles of the moon attempting to find a correlation between the lunar cycle and crime rate. 
    * 	Hypothesis: On days where full moons occur, the crime rates are greater.

## Analysis Process 
*	For the year 2016, we analyzed each month individually to find the below information:
    *   The day the full moon took place in that month
    
    ![Full Moon 2016](./img/fullmoon2016.png)
    
    *   Total number of crimes reported
    *   Average number of crimes per day 
    *   The day with the highest crime rate
    *   The day with the lowest crime rate 
    *   Total crime committed on the day with the full moon
    *   Percentage of monthly crime committed on the day with a full moon
    *   The rank of the crime committed on the day with the full moon in relation to the crime committed on the rest of the month
    *   Bargraph revealing monthly total and line for number of crimes that occured on the full moon

## Conclusions

* Given our analysis, we reject our hypothesis. Crime rates were not impacted by a full moon. 
* Out of the 36 months we looked at there was only one month where the most crime occurred on the full moon. (March in Philadelphia) 
* For all three cities, the annual crime committed on nights with a full moon (12 days) was 3.3%.
     *  For all three cities, the average crime committed per 12 days was 3.3%. 
* We noticed a pattern in weekly activities, alomst like a sin wave. Showing that day of the week has an impact on crime rates.
